The docker run <image_name> command performs the following operations:
1. Downloads the image from the Docker Hub (if not present in the local cache).
2. Create the container with the required start up command. 
3.Start the container which will eventually run the start up command. 

As evident from the above steps, docker run is an amalgamation of "docker create <image_name> 'start-up-command'" and "docker start -a <container_id>". 

Let us run a busybox container using docker create and docker start.

1. docker create busybox echo "hello world!"

	Output:
	docker create busybox echo "hello world!"
	d46d9ef53e0a8edc298b840cc18191510a684dd41a917ff0174d2558e3a70b55

2. docker start -a d46d9ef53e0a8edc298b840cc18191510a684dd41a917ff0174d2558e3a70b55

	Output:
	docker start -a d46d9ef53e0a8edc298b840cc18191510a684dd41a917ff0174d2558e3a70b55
	hello world!


-a option is used with docker start in order to attach the output to the terminal screen. 

What happens if we try to run a different command with docker start?

Command run: docker start -a d46d9ef53e0a8edc298b840cc18191510a684dd41a917ff0174d2558e3a70b55 echo "Bye World!"

	Output:
	docker start -a d46d9ef53e0a8edc298b840cc18191510a684dd41a917ff0174d2558e3a70b55 echo "Bye World!"
	you cannot start and attach multiple containers at once

We see that if we try to run a different startup command, docker gets confused that we are trying to spin up multiple containers and throws an error.
