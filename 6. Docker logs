Docker logs is used to retrieve the output generated by a container during its life.

Let us have a look at the docker logs for an example container on which a ping command was run:

1. docker logs 8e1748e848ad
	Output:
	docker logs 8e1748e848ad
	PING www.google.com (216.58.197.68): 56 data bytes
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=0 ttl=37 time=16.319 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=1 ttl=37 time=16.077 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=2 ttl=37 time=14.757 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=3 ttl=37 time=14.637 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=4 ttl=37 time=14.865 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=5 ttl=37 time=14.451 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=6 ttl=37 time=14.939 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=7 ttl=37 time=14.916 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=8 ttl=37 time=14.717 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=9 ttl=37 time=15.078 ms
	64 bytes from 216.58.197.68: seq=10 ttl=37 time=15.093 ms

As we can see, the docker logs returns the output of the start up command that was initiated (PING command for this particular container)

Let us have a look at the docker logs for an example container on which an echo command was run (the container is stopped):

2.docker logs d46d9ef53e0a
	Output: 
	Î» docker logs d46d9ef53e0a
	hello world!
	hello world!

We can see that 2 instances of hello world was printed out. This means that all the output logs since the beginning of the creation of the container is logged. This involves all the time the container was stopped and started.
