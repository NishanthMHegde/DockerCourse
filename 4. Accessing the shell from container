We can access the shell inside the container in order to execute commands on the container and have a persistent container run. In this way, the container exits only after the user decides to exit from the container using the shell/terminal. 
This can be done by using the docker exec command on a running container. 


1. (Access a stopped container). 

	docker exec -it 8e1748e848ad /bin/sh

	Output:
	Î» docker exec -it 8e1748e848ad /bin/sh
	/ # ls -l
	total 36
	drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         12288 Feb 18 00:41 bin
	drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           340 Feb 25 14:36 dev
	drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Feb 25 14:36 etc
	drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody        4096 Feb 18 00:41 home
	dr-xr-xr-x  139 root     root             0 Feb 25 14:36 proc
	drwx------    1 root     root          4096 Feb 25 14:37 root
	dr-xr-xr-x   11 root     root             0 Feb 25 14:36 sys
	drwxrwxrwt    2 root     root          4096 Feb 18 00:41 tmp
	drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Feb 18 00:41 usr
	drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          4096 Feb 18 00:41 var
	/ # echo "Hello guys!"
	Hello guys!
	/ # pwd
	/
	/ # whoami
	root
	/ # exit

In the above example, we accessed a running container 8e1748e848ad and accessed the shell terminal. Using this shell terminal, we executed few linux commands and then exited the container using the "exit" Linux command.
