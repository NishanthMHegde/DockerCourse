Let us create as simple NodeJS web app that displays Hello World and create an image out of it.

Steps required:
1. Specify base image (node:alpine).
2. Specify the working directory.
3. Copy the code from local machine to working directory in the image.
4. Install the dependencies using npm install.
5. Start the app using the default startup command. 


The Dockerfile for the app would look like:

FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /usr/app

COPY ./ ./

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "start"] 


Command to build the image: docker build -t nishanthmhegde/simplewebapp:latest .

Command to run the container: docker run nishanthmhegde/simplewebapp:latest

Output:
Î» docker run nishanthmhegde/simplewebapp:latest

> SimpleWebApp@1.0.0 start
> node index.js

App is running!


Let us try access our app on the specified port on a browser. 
We get an error on the browser of our local machine. This is because the app is running on a port inside the container but that port cannot be accessed by local machine. We need to do port mapping.
