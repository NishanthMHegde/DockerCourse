In order to fully utilize Docker, we need to be able to reduce the number of image rebuilds.

This can be done by:
1. Placing the instructions to copy the package.json in the beginning.
2. Running npm install to install node dependencies.
3. Copying the code from local machine to the container working directory.

The modified code would look like:

FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /usr/app

COPY ./package.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY ./ ./

CMD ["npm", "start"] 

This will utilize caching to the maxmimum extent for a nodejs app and take into account any code changes as well.
